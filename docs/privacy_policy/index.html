<ul>
<li><strong>Private account information</strong>: If you register on this server, you will be asked to enter an e-mail address and a password.  Your e-mail, password, and the list of user profiles linked to your account are kept private, as well the list of contact “circles” you define, and what users you include in those circles.</li>
<li><strong>Public information</strong>: You may enter profile information such as a username, display name and biography, and upload a profile picture and header image, which are displayed publicly by default. The list of people you follow is listed publicly, the same is true for your followers. Your public posts are delivered to your followers, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are then stored there. When you delete posts, a request for deletion is delivered to your followers. When you post something, the date and time are stored and displayed along with it. The action of boosting or favouriting something is public by default.</li>
<li><strong>Private content</strong>: All posts are stored and processed on the server. Mentions-only posts are delivered only to users who are mentioned in them, and private message are delivered only to their recipients. In some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies of the data are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to those posts only to authorised persons, but other servers may fail to do so. Therefore it’s important to review servers your contacts belong to, keeping in mind that the operators of your server and any receiving server may view such messages, and that recipients may also screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. Do not share any sensitive information. Posts may also contain media attachments, such as pictures, which can be publicly accessed by anyone who knowns their URL.</li>
<li><strong>IPs and other metadata</strong>: We may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server, along with the data/time and name of your browser application.</li>
