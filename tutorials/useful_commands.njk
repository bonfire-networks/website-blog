          <ul class="prose mt-0">
            <li>A Working Bonfire Local Setup: It's important that you have Bonfire up and running locally. If you're encountering any hiccups in setting it up, don't worry - just <a href="">check out our step-by-step guide to run Bonfire locally</a> for a smooth start.</li>
            <li>Understanding of Git and the Command Line: A foundational knowledge of Git and Command Line is essential since we'll be using these tools. If you're not entirely confident with them yet, consider a brief review to get the most out of this tutorial.</li>

      <p class="mt-5 !font-light md:text-xl text-base-content">As you dive into developing your own extension or app with the Bonfire framework, you'll quickly encounter an array of dependencies and extensions to deal with. An extension that includes a function or a component from a different extension is not an exception, but rather a common pattern.</p>
      <p class="mt-5 !font-light md:text-xl text-base-content">This setup means you might likely soon find yourself contributing to multiple extensions simultaneously. Navigating this landscape can be intimidating at first, but Bonfire provides tools to streamline the process.</p>
      <p class="mt-5 !font-light md:text-xl text-base-content">They help you effortlessly synchronize the latest updates across different extensions or efficiently push your updates to all relevant repositories. Understanding these facilities is key to a smooth and productive development experience in the Bonfire ecosystem.</p>
      
      <p class="mt-5 !font-light md:text-xl text-base-content">The full list of available commands are available in the <code>./justfile</code>. Below is a small selection of the most used commands.</p>
