<p><strong>üò´ Tired of social networks that prioritize profit over people?</strong></p>
<p>Today's digital landscape, dominated by a few major platforms, has led to societal polarization, community fragmentation, rampant disinformation, and the rise of extremist ideologies. It's time for a change.</p>
<p><strong>üî• Enter Bonfire</strong></p>
<p>More than just a social network, Bonfire is a toolkit for creating digital spaces that empower communities. Designed with autonomy, safety, and meaningful interactions in mind, Bonfire enables communities to take control of their features, data, and digital environment, free from algorithmic bias and corporate oversight.</p>
<p><strong>üåê Embrace the Power of Federation</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a digital landscape where your community can exchange ideas, collaborate, and grow alongside others, not limited by the platform boundaries, all while maintaining your own autonomy and identity. With Bonfire, you're tapping into a vast, interconnected federation of communities, enriching your experience with diverse perspectives and interactions.</p>
<p><strong>üåü Imagine a digital space where...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communities set their own features and interaction rules</strong>, not algorithms designed to maximize profit.</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy and autonomy are the norms</strong>, not the exceptions.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse voices flourish</strong> in a secure, inclusive environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonfire is more than a platform; it's a tool for creating digital spaces that reflect the identity and needs of your community.</p>

<h2 id="a-framework-for-experimenting">A framework for experimenting <a class="direct-link" href="#a-framework-for-experimenting">#</a></h2>
<p>Every Bonfire platform can be tailored to your community's needs. Choose from a variety of extensions to enable or disable, and select from extensive settings to create your own flavor of Bonfire. This flexibility allows each community to create a digital space that truly reflects its character and needs.</p>
<p>However, creating new features from scratch or modifying existing ones does require diving into the Bonfire codebase. Thankfully, all code is AGPL licensed. This means that any development using Bonfire code becomes available to all, fostering a collaborative development environment where communities can either build upon the existing framework or coordinate and crowdfund for specific needs.</p>
<p>But you don't need technical skills to think and design new digital spaces. Social networks are common goods and any user has enough skin in the game to state their needs about how they want to shape their digital spaces.</p>
<h2 id="bonfire-case-studies">Bonfire case studies <a class="direct-link" href="#bonfire-case-studies">#</a></h2>
<p>While Bonfire is still in its early days, it's already inspiring communities and enthusiasts to design their ideal digital spaces.</p>
<h3 id="open-science">Open Science <a class="direct-link" href="#open-science">#</a></h3>
 <img src="/img/hwd1.png" class="object-cover rounded-lg mx-auto w-full" />
One notable example is Niboe, a scientific community comprising researchers and activists. They approached Bonfire with a vision to create a digital space focused on scientific divulgation and collaboration.
Leveraging Bonfire's modular framework, they're designing a platform that facilitates streamlined academic processes and collaborative research. Key features include the integration of ORCID (professional credentials for login), a finegrained way of sharing and classifying research papers, and an open and more transparent peer-review system. Their goals are not only to boost productivity but also to foster open and transparent scientific communication and collaboration. <a href="/open_science" target="blank">Read more about the case study</a>
<h3 id="learners-community">Learners community <a class="direct-link" href="#learners-community">#</a></h3>
<img src="/img/hwd2.png" class="object-cover rounded-lg mx-auto w-full" />
<p>Bonfire opens up exciting possibilities for learning communities. Imagine a space where learners collaboratively create and curate course materials, engage in discussions, and rate educational resources. Bonfire enables the formation of thematic collections containing links, documents, and various media, all classified by themes, difficulty levels, and more. Specific groups can be created for study and practice, encouraging peer-to-peer learning and teaching. Furthermore, the integration of open badges in Bonfire could incentivize and acknowledge the learning and sharing process among community members.</p>
<h3 id="fablabs-network">Fablabs Network <a class="direct-link" href="#fablabs-network">#</a></h3>
<img src="/img/hwd3.png" class="object-cover rounded-lg mx-auto w-full" />
<p>Students at the Milwaukee School of Engineering used Bonfire to experimnent withs collaboration within their school's Fablabs network.<br>
They envisioned a digital space tailored for inventory tracking across different Fablabs, enabling resource exchange and promoting collaboration. The idea was to create a platform where each Fablab could manage its inventory, making it easier for users to share resources. Additionally, they aimed to implement features for collaborative task management, enhancing the productivity and interconnectedness of the Fablabs network.</p>
<hr>
<p>But most of the time you don't want to create a whole new platform from scratch, instead you may want to add a new feature to your classic bonfire instace, edit an existing feature or tweak the settings in new ways:</p>

  <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
    Proposing a new feature
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>If there's a functionality you feel is missing from Bonfire, this is your opportunity to introduce a new feature. This could be anything from a unique tool for community engagement to a specialized function for content sharing. For instance, you might envision a feature that facilitates collaborative storytelling or a new method for organizing community-driven projects. The goal here is to think creatively and propose features that bring fresh dynamics and capabilities to social networking to empower communities.</p>

    Proposing some addition or deletion to an existing feature
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>If there's an existing feature on Bonfire that almost meets your needs but requires tweaking, you can propose modifications. For example, you might want to add a layer of privacy to a public messaging feature, or remove certain elements from a community dashboard that aren't relevant to your group. This is your chance to refine Bonfire‚Äôs features to better align with your community's specific requirements.</p>

    Proposing a new way to use the same feature
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>Sometimes, innovation lies not in changing the feature itself, but in altering how it is used. For instance, a feature originally designed for event planning could be repurposed for organizing community volunteer efforts. This category is all about creative reimagining of existing tools for new, unexpected uses.</p>

    Proposing a change to the user interface or user experience of a feature
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>User interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) play a crucial role in how interactively and comfortably users engage with a feature. If you believe a feature's UI could be more intuitive, accessible, or visually appealing, or you envision a different user journey to perform the same action, this is where you can suggest those changes. Perhaps it's as simple as increasing font size for better readability or restructuring a page layout for fostering specific outcomes.</p>

    Deleting an existing feature
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>In some cases, less is more. If you feel a certain feature is redundant, not useful, or even counterproductive for your community, proposing its removal can streamline and improve the user experience. The key here is to explain why eliminating this feature will benefit the overall functionality and usability of the platform.</p>

    Adding a new setting preference

  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>This involves introducing new options or preferences in the settings to give users more control over how they use Bonfire. For instance, adding a setting that allows users to customize notification frequencies or choose different themes for their interface can enhance personalization and user satisfaction. This is about empowering users with more choices to tailor their experience on the platform.</p>
