              No, the software or services provided by the Bonfire team will never include any type of advertisement or spy on users. If third party developers try to include any ads, Bonfire users will always have the freedom to use an alternative extension or fork it. Similarly, if a user or instance were used to post sponsored content, you could simply block them (we may also implement shared blocklists in future to help with this).

                      <li>Respects your privacy: End-to-end encryption for private activities (when available) means your data is never seen by the server or anyone else.

                  <li>There will be diverse apps & extensions to choose from. Do you need a basic social app? A collaborative federated blog? A decentralised forum for group discussion? A space for sharing and curating links and files? An offers and needs map and bulletin board for mutual aid? The community is developing unique approaches for these and more.

              <ul>
                  <li><b>Source Code</b>: While there’s a core team building Bonfire, we only control this website and what code is included the official repositories. Any developer can fork parts of the code they want to customise, or go all-in and create their own extensions.</li>
                  <li><b>Infrastructure</b>: Bonfire instances are independently set up by technical users (though we are working to simplify that more and more), for themselves and their friends to use. They can be hosted on a connected device (like a server or even a Rasperry Pi) or on a cloud service. The Bonfire team (and possibly others) may also offer hosted services in the future (most likely tools like a fediverse nomadic identity and syncing service, or encrypted backup storage, rather than full-service hosting of Bonfire apps).</li>
                  <li><b>Functionality</b>: Instance admins can choose which extensions and flavours to include, and users can also tailor their experience according to their needs. Anyone can suggest or request features or changes, though of course getting something done depends on one or more team members or contributors to voluntarily take it on.</li>
                  <li><b>Governance</b>: Bonfire instances form one part of a huge network, collectively called the Fediverse. It is made up of many instances - servers with different orientations, purposes and policies, each one running a specific federated application. Each instance's admin (or better yet, multiple admins selected democratically by its members) chooses what app(s), extensions, and configuration to set up, as well as their instance’s rules (usually in the form of a code of conduct), who can join or remain a user, what instances/groups/users they don’t wish to federate with, what device or cloud service they use, etc. Because instance admins are so powerful, our goal with Bonfire is to give regular users the same choices as much as technically possible, and to enable them to set up their own instances as easily as possible.</li>
                  <li><b>Moderation</b>: Each instance is moderated by different people (typically the admins, or instance moderators), resulting in diverse rules, themes and ambiance. Thus one given instance can suit you better than another, depending on your values, needs and interests.</li>
                  <li><b>Economic</b>: Bonfire and the wider fediverse are backed by volunteers, and not investors, which makes them more resilient. Even if one instance happens to go down, the rest of the network will continue to work uninterrupted. If an app or extension stops being maintained, someone else can pick it up. While there’s no need to “get a return on investment”, we think the fediverse can still improve in resilience, for example by having shared and/or nomadic user identities to avoid being tied to instances that may shut down, and by exploring different models for sustainability of the network and its contributors and participants.</li>
