As we approach v1.0 of Bonfire, we’re looking for volunteers to help us with some user research. We’re particularly interested in hearing from a diverse range of people who may be interested in using Bonfire in a personal or professional capacity .

You do not need any particular technical knowledge, skills, or prior experience of Bonfire.   The user research interviews will be carried out in English by [Dynamic Skillset](https://dynamicskillset.com/) . 

If you are interested in helping us out, please [complete the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrMnj7MBtapIlbiHbPfGFHuuL1Dg9zaNO_Srltcu6Nfno3Zw/viewform). Thanks in advance!

As much as we value and appreciate the effort to participate in our user research, we are unable to offer compensation to the participants at this time. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Thank you!
