Releasing the stable 1.0 version of the Bonfire federated social network requires collaboration with the communities, hackers, tinkerers, and sysadmins who plan to use it.

That's why we're thrilled to announce **Bonfire Expeditions** - a series of co-design initiatives aimed at refining and polishing various aspects of the project. These expeditions will ensure that all the moving parts of Bonfire work together seamlessly, making the project safe and enjoyable for both communities and developers.

Each Bonfire Expedition will focus on one of the following areas:

- **Surveying:** Developer Experience, Onboarding and Documentation 
- **Camp:** Instance Configuration and Tools
- **Care:** Safety and Moderation Features and UX
- **Party:** Installation and Admin 

## Surveying Expedition: Enhancing Developer Onboarding

**Challenge**: Bonfire's modularity and architecture can be intimidating, and the current documentation is insufficient to properly guide developers.

**Objective**: Streamline the developer experience for setting up the Bonfire dev environment, manage and create new extensions.

**How to Participate**:

- We are looking for 5 Elixir developers to begin with 
- Each developer will have a 1-hour pairing session with the Bonfire team
- During the session, the participant will go through the setup of the bonfire developer environment and the creation of a Hello World extension.
- Developers will vocalize their thoughts, doubts, and suggestions throughout the process
- The Bonfire team will provide support and help overcome any obstacles when necessary

**After each session, the Bonfire team will:**

- Compile all feedback and insights
- Incorporate feedback into the codebase and documentation
- Refine the onboarding experience for the next session

**Compensation:**

- Participating developers can request compensation of €50 for their time on the [project’s OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/bonfire-networks)

If you're an Elixir developer who's passionate about the potential of federated social networks and wants to contribute to shaping the future of Bonfire, join us on this expedition! Send a mail to team@bonfire.cafe to participate in the Surveying Expedition, and we'll reach out with all the necessary details.

Together, we can make Bonfire's 1.0 release a truly landmark moment. Let's embark on this journey and build something extraordinary, one expedition at a time!
