In September we have been invited to present bonfire at the [Italian PrivacyWeek](https://privacyweek.it/). We joined Francesco Macchia and Filippo Delle Bianca in a speech titled: ["Does it exist an alternative and a future for social media?"](https://privacyweek.it/event/ce-spazio-per-un-nuovo-social-network/)

Below you can see the bonfire presentation translated in English:
