<!-- # 🐚 **Slow Software for a Burning World** 🔥 -->

Bonfire 1.0 is nearly ready—but we’re not rushing the launch. This isn’t about shipping fast. It’s about building with care.

In a world of “move fast and break things”, we’ve chosen a different tempo. We move slowly — and build what lasts. 

## 💰 **Profit over people: at what cost?**

In the centralized, for-profit model, decisions are fast but unaccountable. Rules shift quietly, power is hoarded, and systems are shrouded in secrecy - and what gets broken as a result?

- **Trust:** Algorithms are bred to addict or manipulate rather than to inform or empower.
- **Communities:** Platforms optimize for engagement and divisiveness becomes profitable.
- **Attention:** Human focus becomes data—extracted like oil to fuel the surveillance economy.
- **Environment:** Scale above all, sustainability be damned.
- **Labour:** Care work such as content moderation is avoided or hidden, and workers are treated as expendable.

Secrecy quietly erodes autonomy. Invisible hands shape our lives **without consent**. As power concentrates, democracy withers and authoritarianism thrives. Algorithms tuned for "engagement" amplify fear, outrage, and division—because that’s what keeps us clicking.

In the end, **the tools meant to connect us are weaponized to divide us**.


## 🎨 **Co-design instead of "move fast and break things"**

In the tech world, products are often hastily launched to test demand and scale, with little regard for broader social consequences. What happens if you flip this script entirely?

At Bonfire, building slowly means making space for real participation. We work in the open, with [co-design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design) starting at the idea stage and every feature treated as an open question. Rather than rushing to call it “done” and moving on, we listen, refine, and release with care — *with* communities, not just *for* them.

- Feedback loops are based on accountability, not just engagement.
- Scaling is replaced with multiplying autonomy.
- The roadmap is shaped by communities, not founder whims or investor meetings.
- Accessibility is designed from the start, not tacked on later.
- Diversity is a strength, not a checkbox.
- Ethics come first, not as damage control.
- Care, community, and consent are foundational.
- Documentation, sharing, and collaboration aren't a chore – they're part of the culture.

We don’t just push out features and see what sticks. We ask: *Who does this serve? Who decides? Who benefits? Who might be harmed?*

## 🐌 **Caracol: a different outlook**

Bonfire isn’t just another app. It’s a modular, federated system that gives you the power to choose, modify, and adapt the tools you need. You don’t just use Bonfire — you shape it. It’s not one tool, it’s a terrain. A toolkit. A network of digital "caracoles".

> The "caracol" (or snail) moves **“despacito pero con rumbo”: slowly, but with direction** and is a symbol used by the [Zapatistas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation) to describe their communities. It represents a spiral where the center is not at the top but at the heart, where everyone is connected. 
 
It’s a metaphor for self-organization, listening, and collaboration—not domination or hierarchy:

- **Listen before acting:** Decision-making is rooted in community, with power shared equally.
- **Don’t break what you don’t understand:** Respect for history, environment, and diversity.
- Process over result: **The “how” matters more than the “what.”**
- **Autonomy > scale:** Systems are designed to fit people, not to scale beyond them.
- Building is **thoughtful and deliberate**, with no single point of control.
- Values nuance over simplicity, adaptability over standardization, and **coexistence over assimilation**.
- Things may be slower and more complex because care and **real people are complex**.


## 🏕️ **The shape of our patience**

The time between an idea and its realisation shapes possibility. Most software gets scoped by the rush to ship something. At Bonfire, we move differently. We gave ourselves time to stretch the vision—beyond social *media* toward social, political, and cooperative *networking*. By chewing through complexity and refusing to compromise on architecture, we didn’t just build an app—we prepared a terrain where new forms of community, governance, and collaboration can take root.

This approach made it possible to:

- **Set a wide horizon** — Bonfire can power anything from a small online discussion space to a federation of municipalities sharing tools for governance and economic exchange.
- **Build deep** — Laying reusable building blocks makes adding or changing features—like moderation systems or scientific collaboration tools—easier rather harder.
- **Test potential, not just features** — Co-designing with real, opt-in research and experiments instead of rushing out MVPs ([Minimum Viable Products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)).
- **Choose sustainability over speed** — Prioritizing long-term goals over short-term wins or trend-chasing pivots.
- **Practice [mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid) and hold space for care** — Making space for life and meeting each other’s needs as a team first, even when that meant slowing down or taking a detour to keep roofs over heads.
- **Reject capitalist logic with intention** — Not just saying no to VC funding, but embodying a different way of building and relating.

We didn’t just avoid the Silicon Valley model—we’re building something else in its place. A method rooted in care, shared power, and deep listening. Now that we’re approaching 1.0, we’re preparing for what often comes next: *first slowly, then suddenly*.

But no matter how fast momentum grows, **we’ll protect our pace**—holding intentional buffers, taking inspiration from Debian’s stable/testing/unstable [release cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_version_history), and staying grounded as the network grows.

**We’re not here to ship fast. We’re here to build what lasts**.


## 🌐 **Federation: multiplying autonomy**

Bonfire federates (i.e., interconnects with other independent platforms) with Mastodon and the wider [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), but for us, federation is more than a protocol—it’s a commitment to autonomy and collaboration:

- Federation isn't for scaling one model, but for interconnecting many.
- Communities govern themselves, connect when they need to, and choose, fork, or create their own tools.
- People shape their tools, not the other way around.
- No centralized power drives decisions—just connected, independent nodes working together.
- Membership shouldn't be a two-tiered system (admins vs users), instead customizable roles, like moderators or curators, empower diverse forms of participation.
- Developers and instance admins may set thoughtful defaults, but ultimate control rests with each individual who can adapt their experience to suit their needs.

We’re not building one massive platform, but many interconnected worlds.

## ✊ **Governance as the foundation**

The way we build is part of what we’re building. Inspired by [sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/), [Bookchin’s municipal confederations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalism), the Zapatistas, and [Rojava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria), governance in Bonfire isn’t bolted on. It’s in the DNA.

- **Participatory decision-making** — Decisions are made collectively, usually by consent rather than consensus or majority vote.
- **Decentralized power** — Modular structures (like sociocratic circles) let different parts of the network self-organize and govern themselves—whether that’s a federated instance, or a team working on a purpose-specific extension or Bonfire flavour.
- **Autonomy in collaboration** — Communities can connect when needed, customize or fork extensions, or opt out of features without breaking the system—interoperable, not uniform.
- **Respect for difference** — Systems are designed to honor diversity, prioritizing coexistence over assimilation.
- **Transparency by default** — Rules, decisions, and source code are open and visible—no secret algorithms or agendas.
- **Accountability** — Feedback loops prioritize accountability to communities over engagement metrics or external pressures.
- **Process over product** — The “how” matters as much as the “what.”

Where tech culture values velocity and replicates corporate hierarchies, Bonfire prioritizes listening, care, and autonomy.

## 🔥 **Bonfire: public interest social networks**

Bonfire isn’t a platform—it’s a *[commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)*. It’s a place to gather, co-create, and build something that lasts, not a product to be sold or a service to use, abuse, or extract from you.

Bonfire’s values, goals, and processes are shaped by the people and communities who choose to participate. As a starting point, we uphold these principles rooted in care, consent, and collective stewardship:

- Decisions are participatory and decentralized, not imposed.
- Tools are designed to respect diversity and adapt to different needs.
- Transparency is a default, not an afterthought.
- No A/B testing on dignity or safety.
- No growth for growth's sake.
- No pivoting away from responsibility or ethics.
- Tools that prioritize real people and relationships over speed and simplicity.

**Bonfire is built for the margins—not the median.** For the communities erased by online platforms in their race to scale. It’s for those who want more than an app—they want **a network they can shape**.

Built for the long haul. *By people, for people*. 

Does this sound like the kind of network you want to be part of?
**Let’s build it — slowly, autonomously, together**.
