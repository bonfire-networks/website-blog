Over the last month, I‚Äôve been working with the [Bonfire](https://bonfirenetworks.org) team to perform some initial user research on the [Zappa project](https://bonfirenetworks.org/posts/bonfire_cos/). The aim of the project, funded by a grant from the [Culture of Solidarity Fund](https://culturalfoundation.eu/stories/culture-of-solidarity-fund/), is to empower communities with a dedicated tool to deal with the coronavirus ‚Äúinfodemic‚Äù and online misinformation in general.

We ended up speaking with 11 individuals and organisations, and have synthesised our initial user research into the first version of a report which is now available.
