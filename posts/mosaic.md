We are thrilled to announce [Mosaic](https://bonfirenetworks.org/mosaic/), a venture by the Bonfire team designed to empower organizations by creating fully customized, federated digital spaces tailored to their unique needs.

üßê Cool, but why?
ü•∏ Glad you've asked... mainly because:

## Yesterday, we used to work in companies. Today, we work in networks.

An organization‚Äôs success today heavily relies on its relationships, partnerships, and alliances Unfortunately, most mainstream platforms are built with a Web 1.0 mindset‚Äîfocused on resource optimization and profit maximization; designed for hierarchical, fixed structures, and with little regard for externalities. In contrast, **Bonfire Mosaic** recognizes that externalities play a critical role in networks, particularly how information flows between different companies. 
These aspects are essential for an organization‚Äôs ability to thrive in a fast-evolving world.

Effective communication flow fosters collaborations, uncovers opportunities, and builds new partnerships, ultimately shaping the success of projects. It helps organizations overcome bottlenecks, resolve conflicts, and manage knowledge gaps. 
The modern organizational landscape is no longer about working in isolation; it‚Äôs about thriving within networks.

Yet, most platforms aren‚Äôt designed to support network-based work. **Bonfire Mosaic** is a collaborative venture to co-design and develop tailored tools that help organizations, collectives, foundations, and consortia transition from outdated, limiting platforms to modern, federated tools that empower them to work and thrive in networks.

## But why the fediverse? 

The **Fediverse** is a growing network of interconnected digital spaces, offering organizations freedom from big tech control and the ability to seamlessly connect with other communities. More importantly, the Fediverse is a hub for innovation in safety, facilitation and moderation design, where people gather to build more meaningful and trusted connections and partnerships, control their tools, and establish relationships free from proprietary algorithms  (Hello Instagram and TikTok), or from the private profit purposes hidden behind the cultrain of the paid fanbase of an egomaniac idiot (Hello X).

The fediverse is an open network where organisations can either fully join or form [their own islands network](https://writer.oliphant.social/oliphant/islands) - based on their own visions and needs.

## Build once, benefit for ever

The Bonfire framework adopts the **AGPL 3.0 license**, meaning any extensions, updates, or forks must follow the same open-source principles.

This mainly reduces to two things:

1. **All the work we do with any company will be open-source and available for anyone to use.**

But because of this:

2. **Everyone benefits from improvements made for other Mosaic clients, creating a virtuous cycle of contributions to the commons that empower all Bonfire users.**

We hope that this approach encourages organizations with similar needs to collaborate, crowdfund features, share costs, and maximize their collective impact. By paying for the Mosaic service, you are also supporting the open source Bonfire framework and all its contributors.
