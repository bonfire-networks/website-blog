Today we're releasing Bonfire Social 1.0: a federated community‑first social network and the modular toolkit that powers it: a framework for building apps on the open social web beyond microblogging. We're pairing the launch with a [crowdfund](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bonfire/community?refcode=ysD_3Grs5UGdSSFrePZkMw) so communities drive what we build next.

If you believe the social web should be open and portable - where your profiles, relationships and data move with you, where governance lives with communities, and where you can build beyond microblogging for community organising, mutual aid, and collective decisionmaking, this is your moment to help.

Please back the campaign, share it, and invite others to make this "last migration" from closed platforms to open, interoperable networks.
