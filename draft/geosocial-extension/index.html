<h2 id="overview">Overview <a class="direct-link" href="#overview">#</a></h2>
<p>This issue explores implementing a basic geosocial extension for Bonfire that enables location-based social interactions without the privacy concerns, gamification and corporate overhead of foursquare.</p>

<h3 id="create-new-activities-in-the-composer">Create new activities in the composer <a class="direct-link" href="#create-new-activities-in-the-composer">#</a></h3>
<p>Currently, our composer only supports notes and articles. To enable check-ins/check-outs, we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity type selector: Dropdown next to user avatar in composer</li>
<li>Dynamic fields: Show relevant inputs based on selected activity type</li>
<li>For check-ins/travel/check-outs: Autocomplete location input</li>
</ul>
<p>Here our standard component, but with a dropdown element next the user avatar to select the activity to publish</p>

The dropdown shows the activity type available, based on the active extensions</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbdd2a62-ab0d-4a28-888e-a5e087835713" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Once the user chooses the activity, the composer includes the needed extra field, in this case for check-in it only adds a autocomplete input for selecting the location.</p>
<p><em>(I added a dropdown next to checkin for switching between checkin - travel - checkout, maybe it's better to show all the 3 options inline?)</em></p>

<h2 id="the-place-page">The place page <a class="direct-link" href="#the-place-page">#</a></h2>
<p>Places should be first-class AP actor.</p>
<p>This transforms places from simple geotags into active participants in the federated web, allowing physical spaces to build communities and curate their digital presence.</p>
<p>This means also that a place should be managed by one or more user.</p>
<p>In the following mockups we envisioned a very basic place page: on the right sidebar there is the About widget, with some extra fields that can be included in the place settings such as: name, address, phone number, email, opening hours, plus some aggregated data if needed, like the amount of check-in in last day/weel/month etc.</p>
<p>The page would have different tabs based on what's most relevant for the place and the extensions enabled, here the check-in feed</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/848fbbef-1ae2-413b-8a88-437659cfcc2e" alt="Image"></p>
<p>and the events feed</p>
<p><br>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/289e91c3-1357-4853-b35f-50f5e8ad8b7d" alt="Image"></p>
<p>We already have most of the building block ready for implementing this, at least for this basic version (eg. focusing only on &quot;public&quot; spaces, not including the event extension, focus on check-in/check-out functionalities).</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="location-pages-for-non-actor-places">Location Pages for Non-Actor Places <a class="direct-link" href="#location-pages-for-non-actor-places">#</a></h2>
<p>For locations from <a href="http://places.pub">places.pub</a> (or similar services) that aren't yet ActivityPub actors, we can create aggregation pages that function like more structured location-specific hashtag pages. Users can follow these locations and explore all related activities in one place.</p>

Next steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a Map view mockup (we do already have one in the bonfire_geolocate extension) to navigate all the places in a interactive way</li>
<li>Add more geosocial activity preview to see how they appear in other feeds</li>
<li>Feedback on proposed UX flow</li>
</ul>
