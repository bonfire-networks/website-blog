<p>As we push toward 1.0, we're facing some specific challenges where community support and contributions would make a real difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DevOps expertise</strong>: We need help streamlining the Docker installation process to make Bonfire more accessible to new users. If you have experience with containerisation and deployment workflows, your contributions would be invaluable.</li>
<li><strong>Elixir developers</strong>: Join us in improving Bonfire's stability and performance. We're focused on eliminating bugs and enhancing the core extensions' reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Financial support</strong>: As a small team of two working full-time on Bonfire, we need community support to sustain development. You can contribute through our <a href="https://opencollective.com/bonfire-networks">Open Collective page</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Federation testing</strong>: We're seeking users willing to set up Bonfire instances and try out federation and interoperability with other fediverse platforms. Your real-world testing helps ensure Bonfire works seamlessly across the fediverse.</li>
<li><strong>Translation</strong>: Please <a href="https://app.transifex.com/bonfire">join us</a> or share this with your multilingual friends!</li>
</ul>
<p>These are our most pressing needs as we approach 1.0.
