    <p>Bonfire is a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons" target="_blank">commons</a></em>–a place to gather, co-create, and build something lasting–beyond products to be sold or services that use, abuse, or extract from you.</p>

    {# <p>Bonfire's values, goals, and processes are shaped by the people and communities who choose to participate. As a starting point, we uphold these principles rooted in care, consent, and collective stewardship: #}

    {# <ul class="italic">
      <li>Decisions are participatory and decentralized, not imposed.</li>
      <li>Tools are designed to respect diversity and adapt to different needs.</li>
      <li>Transparency is a default, not an afterthought.</li>
      <li>No A/B testing on dignity or safety.</li>
      <li>No growth for growth's sake.</li>
      <li>No pivoting away from responsibility or ethics.</li>
      <li>Tools that prioritize real people and relationships over speed and simplicity.</li>
    </ul> #}

   <p> Bonfire is <b>for anyone seeking greater agency, care, and flexibility</b>. For the communities erased by online platforms in their race to scale. It's for those who want more than an app—they want <b>a network they can shape</b>.</p>

    <p>Built for the long haul. <i>By people, for people</i>. </p>

    <p>Does this sound like the kind of network you want to be part of?</p>
    <p><b>Let’s build it — slowly, autonomously, together</b>.</p>
