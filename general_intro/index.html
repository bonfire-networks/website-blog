<p><b>Bonfire is open, community-first social infrastructure.</b> A digital commons where people gather, co-create, and care together.

<p>While Big Tech centralises for profit and blockchain prizes sovereignty over solidarity, both leave collective care and real community needs behind. They erase communities in the race to scale. They turn social life into products that use, abuse, or extract from us. 

<p>Bonfire offers a different path: trusted communities with real autonomy and participatory governance, interconnected across the open web. It empowers communities to shape digital spaces that reflect shared values, like autonomy, mutual care, and collective power.

<p>We design for communities, not abstract “users”. We focus on relationships, not engagement metrics. We're building for the long haul, not for scale or profit.
