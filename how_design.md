### üò∞&nbsp; Tired of social networks that prioritize profit over people?

Today's digital landscape, dominated by a few major platforms, has led to social polarization and fragmentation, the rise of extremist ideologies, and rampant disinformation and harassment. It's time for a change. 

Beyond being a social network, Bonfire is a <em>toolkit</em> for creating digital spaces that empower communities. Designed with autonomy, safety, and meaningful interactions in mind, Bonfire enables communities to take control of their data as well as the features and design of their digital environment, free from algorithmic bias and corporate oversight. 

**üåà&nbsp; Embrace the power of federation**

Imagine a digital landscape where your community can exchange ideas, collaborate, and grow alongside others, not limited by your choice of app or platform, all while maintaining your autonomy and identity. With Bonfire, you're tapping into a vast, interconnected federation of communities (the "fediverse"), enriching your experience with diverse interactions, perspectives and possibilities.  
 
 üåü&nbsp; Imagine a digital space where...

## ü§î&nbsp; Building with Bonfire

Bonfire is a framework designed for community-driven experimentation in creating and governing digital spaces. It goes beyond the usual platform mindset, encouraging communities to use its modular architecture for innovation, customization, and reimagined digital interaction.

The goal is that instead of users having to conform to digital ecosystems they can actively shape and build them. With Bonfire, communities write their own rules, constructing digital spaces that cater to their unique needs.

As we explore how to build with Bonfire, it's essential to understand some fundamental concepts that form the backbone of its digital ecosystem...

## ‚öóÔ∏è&nbsp; A framework for experimenting

Every Bonfire instance can be tailored to the unique needs of its community. Choose from a variety of extensions, and configure the extensive settings to create your own flavour of Bonfire. This flexibility allows each community to create a digital space that truly reflects its character, needs, and goals.

However, creating new features from scratch or modifying existing ones does require diving into the Bonfire codebase. Thankfully, the code is open source and AGPL licensed. This means that any development becomes available to all, fostering a collaborative environment where communities can either take it upon themselves to build upon the framework or coordinate with others to fund and co-create specific features.

But technical skills are not required to design new digital spaces. Social networks should be a common good where everyone with skin in the game can voice their needs and have an impact on how to shape their digital spaces. 


## üî•&nbsp; Bonfire case studies

While Bonfire is still in its early days, it's already inspiring communities and enthusiasts to design their ideal digital spaces. Here are a few examples...


### Open Science

<img src="/img/hwd1.png" class="object-cover rounded-lg mx-auto w-full" />

One notable example is Niboe, a scientific community of researchers and activists. They approached Bonfire with a vision to create a digital space focused on scientific divulgation and collaboration.
Leveraging Bonfire's extensible framework, they're designing a platform that facilitates streamlined academic processes and collaborative research. Key features include the integration of ORCID (professional credentials for login), a fine-grained way of sharing and classifying research papers, and an open and more transparent peer-review system. Their goals include both boosting productivity and fostering open and transparent scientific communication and collaboration. <a href="/open_science" target="blank">Read more about the case study</a>

### Learners community

<img src="/img/hwd2.png" class="object-cover rounded-lg mx-auto w-full" />

Bonfire opens up exciting possibilities for learning communities. Imagine a space where learners collaboratively assemble, curate and rate study materials, and engage in discussions and collaborative exercises. Bonfire can enable the formation of thematic collections containing links, documents, and various media, all classified by themes, difficulty levels, and more. Specific groups can be created for study and practice, encouraging peer-to-peer learning and experimentation. Furthermore, the integration of <em>open badges</em> in Bonfire could help users have their learning and achievements be recognised.

### Fablabs Network

<img src="/img/hwd3.png" class="object-cover rounded-lg mx-auto w-full" />

Students at the Milwaukee School of Engineering used Bonfire to experiment with collaboration within the network of Fablabs in their area.
They envisioned a digital space tailored for inventory tracking across different Fablabs, enabling resource exchange and promoting collaboration. They prototyped a Bonfire extension where each Fablab could manage its inventory, making it easier for users to share resources. Additionally, they aimed to implement features for collaborative task management, enhancing the productivity and interconnectedness of the Fablabs network.

But most of the time you don't want to create a whole new platform from scratch, instead you may want to add a new feature to your Bonfire instance, modify an existing feature, or tweak the settings in new ways...

  <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
    Design and build a new feature
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>If there's a functionality you feel is missing from Bonfire, you can introduce a new feature. This could be anything from a unique tool for community engagement to a specialized feature for content sharing. </p>
     <p>For instance, you might envision a feature that facilitates collaborative storytelling or a new method for organizing community-driven projects. The goal here is to think creatively and propose features that bring fresh dynamics and capabilities to social networking which can empower communities.</p>
    <p>This would typically be a new <em>extension</em> or could be proposed as an addition to an existing one.</p>

  <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
    Change, add, or remove something in an existing feature
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>If there's an existing feature in Bonfire that almost meets your needs but requires tweaking, you can make or propose modifications. For example, you might want to add an extra layer of privacy to a messaging feature, or hide certain elements from a community dashboard that aren't relevant to your group. This is your chance to refine Bonfire‚Äôs features to better align with your community's specific requirements.</p>
    <p>This would typically be proposed as a modification to an existing <em>extension</em>, or the extension could be <em>forked</em> (copied), in which case if the changes are useful for the wider ecosystem it can be published as an extension under a new name.</p>

  <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
    Find a new way to use a feature
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>Sometimes, innovation lies not in changing the feature itself, but in altering how it is used. For instance, a feature originally designed for event planning could be repurposed for organising volunteer efforts in a crisis response situation. This is all about creative reimagining of existing tools for new, unexpected uses.</p>

  <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
    Improve the user interface or user experience of a feature
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>User interfaces (UI) and user experience (UX) play a crucial role in how interactively and comfortably users engage with their digital space. If you believe a feature's UI could be more intuitive, accessible, or visually appealing, or you envision a different user journey to perform the same action, you can suggest or directly implement those changes. Perhaps it's as simple as increasing font size for better readability or restructuring a page layout for fostering specific outcomes.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>In some cases, less is more. If you feel a certain feature is redundant, not useful, or even counterproductive for your community, proposing its removal (or the addition of a <em>setting</em> so it can be enabled/disabled as needed) can streamline and improve the user experience. The key here is to explain why removing this feature will benefit the overall functionality and usability of the platform.</p>

<div class="collapse collapse-arrow border border-base-content/20">
  <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" /> 
  <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">

  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>This involves introducing new options or preferences in Bonfire's <em>settings</em> to give users more control over how they use Bonfire. For instance, adding a setting that enables users to customize the frequency of notifications or to choose different fonts for their interface can enhance personalisation and user satisfaction. This is about empowering users with more choices to tailor their experience on the platform.</p>
