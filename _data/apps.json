This App facilitates enhanced coordination of activities, discussions within specific groups, and the implementation of more nuanced governance structures and role definitions. Key features of the Bonfire Community app include the introduction of 'Groups' and 'Topics.' 'Groups' allow users from various instances to engage in discussions, with the flexibility to set specific visibility and permission levels. On the other hand, 'Topics' provide a structured way to organize discussions, ensuring that different subjects are not conflated within the same group. This organizational approach helps maintain clarity and focus in community conversations.",
