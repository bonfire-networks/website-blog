We envision these implementations being crafted in the open, through a co-designing process that unites scientists, researchers, and activists. This collective effort will ensure that the developed features meet the meticulous standards of academic tools while leveraging the user experience of social networks. It is our aspiration that this will spark meaningful conversations and broaden the accessibility of scientific discussions to a wider audience, fostering a vibrant, inclusive, and interconnected global knowledge community.",
