<h3 id="summary">Summary <a class="direct-link" href="#summary">#</a></h3>
<p>Open Science Network (OSN) will develop a breakthrough federated social infrastructure connecting researchers directly with FAIR data objects across open science infrastructures—including archives, publishers, data warehouses, software repositories, and research information providers. OSN enhances traditional repository experiences by embedding social interaction within scientific workflows, creating a virtuous cycle where discussions become properly attributed, machine-readable FAIR objects with persistent identifiers.</p>
<p>Unlike isolated commercial platforms, OSN leverages Bonfire' extensible federated architecture to ensure researchers and their organizations maintain complete digital sovereignty while creating comprehensive provenance chains between discussions and referenced data. By transforming informal knowledge exchange that typically disappears in email threads or closed platforms into an identified and searchable part of the scientific record, OSN addresses critical gaps in the current research ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="key-challenges"><strong>Key Challenges</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#key-challenges">#</a></h3>
<p>Current scientific infrastructure faces critical barriers measurably impeding research impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement Crisis</strong>:<br>
Repository silos experience 69% fewer citations over 5 years compared to social platforms, with academic repositories failing to generate interaction metrics needed for discovery [^2];</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Capture</strong>:<br>
Academic networks like ResearchGate dominate with 54.3% researcher participation while truly open science platforms attract only 15%, creating walled gardens that extract value while limiting FAIR principles adoption[^3] ;</li>
<li><strong>Lost Discourse and Knowledge Fragmentation</strong> :<br>
Valuable scientific dialogue occurs in scattered, non-FAIR environments where domain silos create &quot;significant barriers to interdisciplinarity&quot;[^4], limiting cross-domain discovery with one study revealing 86% of medical research data is never reused after publication[^5].</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposed-solution"><strong>Proposed Solution</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#proposed-solution">#</a></h3>
<p>Open Science Network implements a federated social layer through established W3C standard protocols (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>[^6] and <a href="https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">OAI-PMH</a>[^7]). This server-to-server federation enables real-time interconnection between research actors, institutions, and outputs, all properly identified through ORCID, ROR, and DOI persistent identifiers. Authenticated interactions become citable and searchable FAIR objects with complete attribution chains and machine-readable licensing. Through ORCID/OpenAlex API integration, the platform connects researchers' social interactions with their professional profiles, creating an open alternative to platforms like ResearchGate and <a href="http://Academia.edu">Academia.edu</a> without compromising data ownership or research integrity.</p>
<p>Our system strategically focuses on developing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repository Connector Framework</strong>: Specialized connectors for Dataverse and Knowledge Commons Works with modular design for future expansion to additional research infrastructures</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Federation Protocol</strong>: Extending ActivityPub with formal JSON-LD scientific metadata representations</li>
<li><strong>FAIR Discussion Engine</strong>: Automating transformations of scientific discussions into FAIR digital objects</li>
<li><strong>Federated Research Groups</strong>: Domain-specific collaborative spaces with granular permission controls</li>
<li><strong>Software Preservation Integration</strong>: Bidirectional connections with Software Heritage for scientific software preservation</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Repository Knowledge Graph</strong>: Citation networks spanning multiple repositories to discover connections between datasets, publications, software, and discussions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scientific-impact"><strong>Scientific Impact</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#scientific-impact">#</a></h3>
<p>Open Science Network will transform research practices through a rigorous co-design process with our diverse pilot partners—representing key stakeholders across the scientific production, distribution, preservation, and consumption ecosystem.

<li>Full attribution for all contributions, including discussions</li>
<li>Enhanced discovery of relevant datasets and software through social connections</li>
<li>Career advancement through documented impact of contributions</li>
<li>Access controls that balance openness with confidentiality for sensitive data</li>
</ul>
<p>OSN addresses platform lock-in by making scholarly social capital—profiles, discussions, and relationships—portable, persistent, and formally recognized through ORCID and DOIs attribution.</p>
<p><strong>For institutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to host instances that maintain institutional codes of conduct and data sovereignty</li>
<li>Analytics on research engagement and impact</li>
<li>Integration with existing institutional repositories</li>
<li>Support for institutional open science policies</li>
<li>Customizable functionality, user experience, and branding</li>

<p>Whereas platforms like Bluesky may be 'federatable in theory,' OSN is federated in practice from day one, with multi-institutional pilots, open protocols, and no single controlling authority. OSN provides both the technical and social means needed to overcome the fragmentation and inertia that have undermined previous platform migrations by academics. While other platforms come with lock-in or high switching costs, OSN’s federation and open standards ensure that researchers, institutions, and communities can move, fork, or self-host their networks and data at any time—eliminating lock-in and returning control to the academic sector.</p>
<h2 id="addressing-questions-of-high-societal-relevance"><strong>Addressing Questions of High Societal Relevance</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#addressing-questions-of-high-societal-relevance">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="1.-establishing-community-governed-scientific-networks"><strong>1. Establishing Community-Governed Scientific Networks</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#1.-establishing-community-governed-scientific-networks">#</a></h3>
<p>Recent studies show approximately 75% of researchers use commercial and closed academic platforms despite growing concerns about data ownership and privacy[^20].</p>
<p>The Open Science Network demonstrates a viable federation model where governance is distributed across institutions while maintaining interoperability. Our pilot partners represent diverse governance models (public university, national research institution, global archive, open access publisher) to validate adaptability across contexts.</p>
<h3 id="2.-enhancing-reproducibility-across-disciplines"><strong>2. Enhancing Reproducibility Across Disciplines</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#2.-enhancing-reproducibility-across-disciplines">#</a></h3>
<p>The European Commission has recognized research waste as a critical challenge, establishing Open Research Europe specifically to &quot;implement Open Science practices and to support research integrity, transparency and reproducibility as well as to prevent 'research waste'&quot; (Open-access.network, 2021). By connecting discussions directly to data objects, code, and methods, Open Science Network creates environments where reproducibility challenges can be documented and addressed collaboratively. Our Software Heritage integration specifically enables linking discussions to preserved code versions, enhancing computational reproducibility.</p>
<h3 id="3.-accelerating-interdisciplinary-collaboration-on-complex-challenges"><strong>3. Accelerating Interdisciplinary Collaboration on Complex Challenges</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#3.-accelerating-interdisciplinary-collaboration-on-complex-challenges">#</a></h3>
<p>Climate change, pandemic response, and sustainable development require cross-disciplinary approaches that current siloed repositories hinder. Our cross-repository discovery mechanisms will enable researchers to find relevant data through human social connections rather than keyword searches alone.</p>
<p>By addressing these questions, Open Science Network provides the technical foundation for researcher-governed scientific discourse that connects directly to research outputs, enabling a more integrated, transparent, and collaborative scientific process. This aligns with the 2020 Leiden Manifesto's emphasis on community governance of research evaluation and the European Open Science Cloud's mission to make research more discoverable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.</p>
<h1 id="scientific-impacts">Scientific impacts <a class="direct-link" href="#scientific-impacts">#</a></h1>
<p>Open Science Network (OSN) will fundamentally transform scientific collaboration by creating the missing bridge between data repositories and scientific discourse—addressing critical gaps in the current research ecosystem while generating substantial new scientific knowledge through interconnected innovations that go beyond the state of the art.</p>
<h2 id="extending-scientific-knowledge-beyond-current-boundaries"><strong>Extending Scientific Knowledge Beyond Current Boundaries</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#extending-scientific-knowledge-beyond-current-boundaries">#</a></h2>
<p>Currently, platforms like ResearchGate facilitate social interaction around publications but create closed ecosystems where valuable discussions remain inaccessible and non-FAIR. Conversely, data repositories store FAIR objects but lack the social engagement capabilities that drive scientific discovery. OSN resolves this contradiction by pioneering a federated social layer that preserves the context in which scientific insights emerge.</p>
<p>By implementing W3C Web Annotation standards and RDA's Data Citation guidelines, OSN will transform ephemeral scientific discussions into properly attributed, machine-readable FAIR data objects with permanent identifiers. This advancement preserves valuable scientific context that is currently lost in private communications, creating a new category of scientific objects that capture the genesis of ideas and critiques.</p>
<p>OSN pioneers federated group structures that enable multidisciplinary, cross-institutional research teams to collaborate seamlessly across traditional boundaries. Unlike existing tools that require centralized platforms or formal institutional agreements, our federation protocols allow spontaneous formation of research communities around emerging scientific questions, preserving both institutional autonomy and individual attribution while generating new FAIR data objects.</p>
<h2 id="engaging-multiple-scientific-communities"><strong>Engaging Multiple Scientific Communities</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#engaging-multiple-scientific-communities">#</a></h2>
<p>OSN is uniquely positioned to engage diverse scientific ecosystems through our targeted pilot implementations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Commons at Michigan State University</strong> (humanities/social sciences) with its community of 50,000+ active users</li>
<li><strong>Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt</strong> (Germany's national metrology institute)</li>
<li><strong>UNIF</strong> (French University Digital Infrastructure)</li>
<li><strong>Université de Lorraine</strong> (Large multidisciplinary French university)</li>
<li><strong>eLife/Sciety</strong> (implementing DocMaps protocol integration)</li>
<li><strong>Software Heritage</strong> (global code archive) containing 12+ billion source files</li>
</ol>
<p>This multi-domain approach ensures OSN addresses varying needs across research disciplines, facilitating collaboration across traditionally siloed fields. By connecting repositories from different domains through a unified social layer, we enable researchers to discover and engage with data outside their immediate field—a capability critical for addressing complex societal challenges requiring interdisciplinary approaches.</p>
<p>The federated architecture of OSN respects the diversity of scientific practice by allowing communities to maintain autonomy while participating in the broader network. Unlike centralized platforms that impose uniform policies, OSN enables communities to establish their own moderation policies and collaboration norms while ensuring interoperability—a critical consideration for cross-disciplinary engagement.</p>
<p>OSN also specifically addresses the &quot;long tail of science&quot; by providing open-source software that can be deployed with minimal requirements (single virtual machine). This democratizes access to sophisticated collaboration tools, enabling smaller research groups, individual researchers, and resource-constrained institutions to participate in the scientific ecosystem on equal footing with larger entities.</p>
<p>Our tiered authentication systems accommodate citizen scientists while maintaining verification standards, and our contribution taxonomies properly attribute diverse forms of participation. This inclusive approach broadens the scientific community and leverages diverse perspectives that enrich scientific discourse.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-research-infrastructures-beyond-science-clusters"><strong>Supporting Research Infrastructures Beyond Science Clusters</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#supporting-research-infrastructures-beyond-science-clusters">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>OSN extends beyond current Science Clusters through its extensible repository connector framework. While our initial implementation focuses on specific repositories (InvenioRDM, Dataverse, Zenodo, Software Heritage), we are developing a generalized connector framework allowing integration with any standards-compliant repository. This ensures OSN can support additional ESFRI RIs without requiring complete redevelopment.</li>
<li>By enabling researchers to discover and engage with data across multiple RIs through a unified social interface, OSN addresses the fragmentation currently limiting cross-RI collaboration. Researchers can discuss climate datasets alongside social impact data from entirely different sources, creating interdisciplinary insights difficult to achieve through existing isolated interfaces.</li>
<li>Emerging Research Infrastructures gain particular value from OSN by obtaining immediate connectivity to the broader scientific ecosystem without requiring massive investment in custom social tools. Our lightweight deployment options require minimal infrastructure, allowing resource-constrained RIs to participate fully.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measurable-scientific-impacts"><strong>Measurable Scientific Impacts</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#measurable-scientific-impacts">#</a></h2>
<p>OSN will deliver five significant scientific impacts that will be systematically measured throughout the project:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enhanced Data Discovery and Reuse:</strong> We will establish baseline discovery rates through pre-project surveys and target substantial increases in dataset accesses and citations for connected repositories. This will be measured through access logs, DOI resolution statistics, and citation tracking via DataCite, with measurements at key project milestones.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:</strong> Based on initial bibliometric analysis, we aim to significantly increase cross-disciplinary dataset utilization, measured through network analysis of researcher interactions and citation patterns across disciplinary boundaries. We will track this progress regularly throughout the project lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Democratized Access to Scientific Discourse:</strong> Building from current geographic and institutional diversity in repository usage, we target broad international participation with particular focus on Global South inclusion. We will conduct regular diversity tracking from launch with quarterly progress reports.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Scientific Transparency and Reproducibility:</strong> The connection between discussions and data objects will enhance scientific transparency by making the context around datasets explicitly visible. We will measure this by tracking how often dataset reuse incorporates references to Open Science Network discussions, with a focus on improved reproducibility confirmation rates for datasets with active discussions.</li>
<li><strong>New Research Question Generation:</strong> We will document the emergence of novel research questions spanning multiple disciplines by analyzing discussion threads and coding for question novelty and cross-disciplinarity, with validation from an independent expert panel. This qualitative and quantitative assessment will demonstrate how connected conversations around scientific objects spark new research directions.</li>
</ol>
<p>These impact measurements will be incorporated into our regular reporting and final deliverables, providing concrete evidence of how OSN transforms scientific collaboration and knowledge creation.</p>
<h2 id="alignment-with-european-science-policy-objectives"><strong>Alignment with European Science Policy Objectives</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#alignment-with-european-science-policy-objectives">#</a></h2>
<p>OSN directly supports multiple European science policy priorities:</p>
<p><strong>Digital Sovereignty:</strong> By providing a community-governed alternative to commercial platforms, OSN advances European digital sovereignty in scientific infrastructure, aligning with the European Strategy for Data's emphasis on developing alternatives to dominant platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Open Science Implementation:</strong> OSN contributes directly to EOSC by providing social infrastructure that enhances the utility of existing EOSC resources, supporting the goal of making open science the new normal by embedding FAIR principles in researchers' daily collaborative practices.</p>
<p><strong>Responsible Research Assessment:</strong> By developing attribution mechanisms that recognize diverse contributions to scientific knowledge, OSN supports the transition toward more nuanced research assessment models beyond simple bibliometric measures.</p>
<p><strong>Research Integrity Enhancement:</strong> The transparency afforded by connecting discussions directly to data objects enhances research integrity by making methodological considerations explicitly visible, fostering environments where critical engagement with methods and results is preserved.</p>
<p>Through this comprehensive approach to transforming scientific discourse, OSN creates lasting infrastructure for cross-disciplinary, cross-institutional collaboration that accelerates scientific discovery while ensuring equitable participation across the research ecosystem—directly supporting the European Open Science Cloud's mission to make research more discoverable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.</p>
